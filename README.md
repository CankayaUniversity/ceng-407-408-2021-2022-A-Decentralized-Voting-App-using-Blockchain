# 1 INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose of This Document

This System Requirement Specification document aims to provide information on how to
create an e-Voting system that will take place over the online platform instead of the
traditional election. This document provides detailed information about the requirements for
the online voting project. It mentions the limitations in the project, all hardware and software
functions. It includes all the phases that the project will go through and the positions of the
users on the project and their functions. This document is intended for system end users,
system architects and system developers.

## 1.2 Purpose of This Document

Users who vote in traditional elections are not sure of the accuracy of the election results.
While not sure of its accuracy, it also deciphers transparency and confidentiality. Traditional
voting also takes a long time to conclude. It is possible to replace the traditional voting system
with an easier one: Decentralized Voting System. In this project, voting will be done through
the virtual system. This project will be realized with a blockchain-based system and security
will be provided. Ethereum technology will be used in the project, so there is no need to
provide any confidentiality in the selection. The system will be voting based. Poll and open
voting will be applied.
Many choices can be made in the system. Different voting platforms can take place at the
same time. Admin, one of the user characters that will benefit from the system, has all the
management of the system. First of all, voters and candidates who will benefit from other
benefits must be members of the system. Each candidate will have a personal profile on the
election page that includes the information, promises and answers to the questions asked
about the person. Although there are relevant election boards in the system, the system
provides voters with the right to vote for candidates who are candidates. Voters cast their
votes for their preferred candidate. The votes made are secured by the admin's controls.
Elections will be updated as instant results after each vote. After the voting period for each
election expires, the result is announced to the screen on the election page.
Voting with DVS is accurate, reliable and fast.

## 2.2 Overview Requirements

The system must provide and secure an account for each user who will benefit from the
system. Since the votes to be cast will be made through these accounts, the security of the
system must be at a high level. The system must ensure the accuracy of the recorded data and
report them. In this way, it provides the confidence of the voters. At the same time, the system
should identify the needs of the users and ensure that they benefit from the system to meet
them. The requirements to ensure these are listed:

**Functional Requirements**

- A trial version must be provided before the system is put into use.
- The system should make it mandatory to open an account for each user to vote.
- The system should provide users with accurate data.
- A user interface should be designed where users can vote easily and quickly.
- The system should inform the voters about how to vote online.
- Voters should be informed about whom they can vote for.
- The system should send a confirmation notice to the voter to ensure that the vote he will use is correct.
- The system must record and count each vote to be cast.
- Only one voting restriction should be given to each voter.
- There should be no marking at the beginning of the voting.
- The voter must be able to verify the vote before it is cast.Voters should not vote for more than one candidate at the same time.
- If the voter does not exercise his right to vote for any candidate, he should not be
  included in the voting count.
- A system should be established to verify that all votes have been counted correctly.
- If there is any problem during the voting, a notification report should be sent to the system administrator.
- A notification should be sent to the system administrator when any changes are made in the system.
- Changes made in the database should be preserved.

**Functional Requirements**

- Each voter who will use the system must be registered.
- The account opened by the voter must be verified and it must be ensured that it belongs to him.
- The election system should work in such a way that there is no loss of votes, and network communication should be strong. It should be hardened for malicious attacks and designed to provide control.
- The system should allow voting until the end of the election period. Date and time settings must be provided correctly.
- The system should not allow tampering with audit logs.
- Vote tracking should be ensured to ensure that all ballot papers are registered to a voter.

**Non-functional Requirements**

- The number of people who will use the system is determined.
- Browsers supported by the system are determined.
- The hardware features of the devices supported by the system are determined.
- In the system, the hours between which votes will be given are determined.

# 3 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

## 3.1 Interface Requirements

- ### 3.1.1 Candidates
  The system must provide a user interface for all types of users. The user interface must
  be different for Election Authority and Voters.
- ### 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
  There are no hardware interfaces to this software system. The only interfaces are
  through a computer system.
- ### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces
  The election runs on http server. It uses a relational database and blockchain database to
  keep track of the polls.
- ### 3.1.4 Communications Interfaces
  Invoke Composite protocol smart contracts using traditional HTTP requests, using
  Infura as the bridge between the Ethereum network and the system.MetaMask is using
  for signup/in to the system via ethers.js. Hardhat will compile and deploy our smart
  contract to the node that Infura initiate for us.

# 4 DEVELOPING USE CASE

Use Case gives information about the design of the project, defines its steps and functionality.
It explains on the scenario how the user will interact with the system under the specified
conditions. The system end user's perspective is shown in both the storytelling and the
schematic template.
USE CASE : Voting
Actor : Voter is the person authorized to vote in the system. Admin, the person responsible for
system administration.
Goal : His vote must be kept safe and no one should know.
Precondition : A record of the voter who will vote must be created in the system. It must be
ensured and verified that the account created belongs to him.

Scenario :

1. Voter logs in to the website with MetaMask.
2. User needs two fields. These are: Public Address and Nonce. Public Address is the
   unique user address of MetaMask. Nonce is a randomly generated number for security
   purposes.
3. If he/she doesn't have an account, he/she creates an account.
4. Enters name, surname, date of birth, gender, e-mail, telephone and voter school card
   information he/she has.
5. The voter's account is verified by the admin.
6. The voter logs into the system after receiving approval.
7. The voter is presented with the choices available.
8. He/she prefers the choice he/she will vote for.
9. Voters see the list of candidates with their information.
10. Voters vote according to their own preference.
11. A confirmation notification is sent to the voter for the vote he/she will cast.
12. If the vote reaches the server, a message is shown to the voter that the vote has
    reached the ballot box.
13. If all voters have voted or the time has expired, the results are shown.
14. The candidate with the most ether as a result of voting wins the voting.
15. Voter exits.

Exceptions :

1. The voter's account may not be approved.
2. The voter may try to choose more than the allowed options.
3. The voter's connection to the server may be terminated before the vote reaches the
   server.
4. The voter can be disconnected from the server during the session.
5. After the vote has been cast, the voter can try to return to cast another vote.
